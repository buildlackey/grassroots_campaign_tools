Initial project set-up assumes you have installed required dependencies (frameworks, etc).

Current development flow assumes you are on Nixos-based Linux (but we could provide support for other
platforms in our scripted set-up at some point.)


for nixos, init dev env via:

    nix-shell    # this inits dependecies for your current shell seesion per shell.nix

What Can Be Scripted After Manual Billing Setup
Once the billing account exists, scripting becomes easy and safe. You can:

✅ Script These:
Task	Scriptable?	Notes
Create GCP project	✅	gcloud projects create
Link billing	✅	gcloud beta billing projects link
Enable APIs	✅	gcloud services enable ...
Push clasp scripts	✅	clasp push, etc.
Set budget alerts	✅	gcloud beta billing budgets create






OLD instructions:
Setting up distance tools on new google account (e.g., a test account for dev purposes / script enhancement)

1.  manually create test google account
2.  link to billing acct
    export TEST_ACCOUNT_EMAIL={email of your new test account}
    bash link_to_main_acct_billing.sh  $GOOGLE_ACCT $TEST_ACCOUNT_EMAIL

npm install -g @google/clasp@2.4.1
might need to do this because the latest versions (e.g. 2.4.2 and newer) introduced a breaking change in how .clasp.json and .clasprc.json were handled, especially around:

    Broken or noisy clasp run behavior:

    clasp run began prompting for scopes or failing outright even when scopes were correct.

    Some of these issues appeared around v2.4.2+ due to changes in how runtime credentials and scopes are checked.

    Weird merge of Code.js vs Code.gs behavior:

    A regression where files downloaded as .gs (server default), but clasp confused them with .js locally, especially when both existed.
