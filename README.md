Initial project set-up assumes you have installed required dependencies (frameworks, etc).

Current development flow assumes you are on Nixos-based Linux (but we could provide support for other
platforms in our scripted set-up at some point.)


for nixos, init dev env via:

    nix-shell    # this inits dependecies for your current shell seesion per shell.nix
