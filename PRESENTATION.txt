Presentation Planning Notes: Google Sheets Extension Project
User is preparing a code-driven, nonlinear presentation on their Google Sheets extension project.
The presentation will cover multiple dimensions:
- Pro-democracy and grassroots motivation behind the tool.
- Feature walkthroughs with potential video demonstrations.
- Detailed code explanations assuming some Google Cloud familiarity.
- A short tutorial on Google Cloud permissions and setup.
- Overview of the final tech stack (TypeScript, Jest, Webpack, etc.).
- A reflection on the user's journey: transitioning from backend/jQuery roots to shipping a Google Marketplace
extension.
A major theme in the presentation is the role AI (ChatGPT) played in enabling rapid development:
- Debugging and troubleshooting assistance.
- Scaffolding scripts and build environments.
- Help navigating Google Cloud IAM and OAuth intricacies.
- Help structuring clean, modular TypeScript code for Apps Script.
- Writing tests and structuring Jest test cases.
Framing Idea for the Presentation:
-----------------------------------
From jQuery to Marketplace: Augmented Development in 2025
- Started with deep backend experience but minimal modern frontend/cloud skills.
- Faced daunting barriers:
 - Google Cloud IAM and API setup
 - TypeScript build tooling
 - Sidebar UX with dynamic JavaScript injection
 - Marketplace-level polish and permission management
- Used AI (ChatGPT) as a full-spectrum development assistant:
 - Instant doc lookup, Bash scripting help
 - Code reviews and rewrites
 - Context-aware debugging
 - Scaffolding test infrastructure
- Result: Functional, secure, user-friendly extension-built solo, shipped fast.
Quote: "Without this AI scaffolding, I wouldn't have started the project-too much yak to shave. With it, I built
something I'm proud of and could scale."
Tools for Future Presentation Development:
------------------------------------------
- reveal.js: Code-driven HTML slides, great for nonlinear navigation.
- Google Slides: Easy collaboration, live demo integration.
- Notion: Good for knowledge sharing, code snippets, and contextual links.
- GitHub Pages + Markdown: For technical blogs or walkthroughs.
- Canva / Pitch: For polished, public-facing decks with rich visuals.
Next Steps:
-----------
- Archive this discussion as a reference.
- Decide on target audience focus (technical, campaign, or mixed).
- Choose a slide platform based on flexibility and presentation mode.
