/**
 * Webpack configuration for Google Apps Script bundling.
 *
 * üîß Purpose:
 * This config transforms and bundles TypeScript source files for use in the Apps Script environment.
 *
 * üß± Build Lifecycle:
 *   - TypeScript files are compiled directly by Webpack (via `ts-loader`) - module rules declared to pick up '*.ts'
 *   - Webpack bundles these into `build/gas_safe_staging/`, stripping unsupported module syntax
 *   -   Also key: Webpack injects methods into the equivalent of globalThis entry points
 *       which are required since GAS environment wants everything in a flat namespace.  
 *       That is where __webpack_require__.g comes in.  This is Webpack's internal globalThis shim which 
 *       provides a consistent global object reference across various JavaScript environments ‚Äî 
 *       including browsers, Node.js, and older runtimes that may not support globalThis natively.
 *
 * üì¶ What Webpack does:
 *   1. Loads `.ts` source files and transpiles them via `ts-loader`
 *   2. Removes unsupported module features like `import`/`export`
 *   3. Automatically injects `globalThis.myExportedFunction = myExportedFunction`  (using its globalThis analog)
 *      for each exported symbol, using `gas-webpack-plugin`
 *   4. Outputs GAS-safe `.js` files into `build/gas_safe_staging/`
 *
 * üöÄ Only files in `build/gas_safe_staging/` are pushed to Apps Script using `clasp push`.
 *
 * ‚úÖ Result:
 * Apps Script can call TypeScript-defined logic as global functions without module errors.
